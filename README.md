# Marketing KPI GenAI

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Generative AI fine-tuning workflow** for marketing KPI insights, using synthetic campaign data. It showcases the end-to-end process from **data preparation, fine-tuning a LoRA model, to inference and actionable insights**.  

The goal is to create a strong portfolio piece for an **AI/Generative AI Engineer**, highlighting skills in:

- Data preprocessing for AI fine-tuning
- Custom LoRA-based fine-tuning of large language models
- Generating interpretable insights from raw campaign metrics
- Deployable notebook workflows and reproducible pipelines
